<h1>Project Summary</h1>
BEEPy is an attempt to implement the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol
as a Python library. It makes use of the 
<a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">twisted</a> framework to provide
low-level socket communication over TCP.
<p>
For more information on BEEP, check out 
<a href="http://www.beepcore.org/beepspecs.html">
beepcore.org</a>.

<h1>Project Status</h1>
BEEPy is currently transitioning from alpha stage to beta stage. 
The library has achieved a base level of functionality and can be used 
to build BEEP applications. It provides support for SASL/ANONYMOUS and
SASL/OTP authentication as well as TLS for transport layer security.
<p>
Example code and accompanying documentation is provided. More examples
and documentation are added as the API stabilises. For the latest
distribution
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=58978">
download version 0.6.</a>
<p>
For the latest code, check out the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=58978">CVS tree</a>.

<a href="api/">API Documentation</a>, generated by epydoc is
available online at <a href="api/">http://beepy.sourceforge.net/api</a>.
<p>
The developers also maintain a more informal website over at eigenmagic.
SourceForge is used for the more structured side of the project with the
rough and tumble weirdness left to

<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>
There are three mailing lists that you can join over at SourceForge. There
used to be links to the lists themselves here, but thanks to the wonders
of modern spam, we've had to remove them. All the lists are moderated purely
to prevent spam from reaching list subscribers. If you'd like to get
updates on the world of BEEPy, wander over to SourceForge and subscribe!
