<p>Welcome to the home page of ACOPOST, a free and open source
collection of part-of-speech taggers.  In corpus linguistics,
part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST), also called grammatical
tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up
the words in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of
speech, based on both its definition, as well as its context â
i.e. relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase,
sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught
to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns,
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Once performed by hand, POS tagging
is now done in the context of computational linguistics, using
algorithms which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of
speech, in accordance with a set of descriptive tags.

  <dt><em>Current status</em> (2012-11-22)</dt>
  <dd>The version patched for 64-bit systems is ready in Git. The bugs
  in <tt>t3</tt> and <tt>met</tt> related to large and/or noisy
  lexicons seem to have been fixed. The maintenance team has been
  expanded to three members. We have made it compile and work on Mac
  OS X, and have created autoconf/automake scripts, as well as an RPM
  spec file. We are close to being able to make a release of a new
  version. Until we make the release, users interested in the new
  version should clone
  the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/acopost/code">Git
  repository</a>. For more information on the project, please write me
  (Tiago).</dd>

  <dt>2010-03-04</dt>
  <dd>Created a git repository for the project, including this web
      page. Access information is given at
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/acopost/develop">https://sourceforge.net/projects/acopost/develop</a>,
      code can be browsed online

  <dt>2010-03-04</dt>
  <dd>Project changes: Tiago Tresoldi is the new maintainer; besides a
      new home page, the programs are being adapted to 64-bit systems
      and code is being cleaned.</dd>

  <dt>2007-05-13</dt>
  <dd>Tiago Tresoldi released his own patched version of ACOPOST, 1.8.6, which compiled with <tt>gcc</tt>
      versions 3 and 4, on his <a href="http://hermes.sf.net/">Hermes project page</a>.</dd>

  <dt>2002-09-23</dt>
  <dd>Renamed ICOPOST to ACOPOST and moved the package to the
      Sourceforge repository of open source projects.  Released
      version 1.8.4, which contained a preliminary user's guide. The
      project was put on halt since Ingo SchrÃ¶der (the original
      maintainer) would not have the time to maintain the
      package.</dd>

  <dt>2002-04-24</dt>
  <dd>Released version 1.8.3 beta, containing an additional tagger
  based on example-based techniques.</dd>

<h2>What is ACOPOST about?</h2>

<p>Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the task of assigning grammatical
classes to words in a natural language sentence.  It's important
because subsequent processing stages (such as parsing or sentence
translaiton) become easier if the word class for a word is
available. </p>

<p>Here's an English example of a tagged sentence taken from the Wall
Street Journal of the Penn Treebank:</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
  <tr> <th>Word</th>          <th>Part-of-speech tag</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Measures</td>      <td>NNS</td>                </tr>
  <tr> <td>of</td>            <td>IN</td>                 </tr>
  <tr> <td>manufacturing</td> <td>VBG</td>                </tr>
  <tr> <td>activity</td>      <td>NN</td>                 </tr>

<p>ACOPOST is a set of freely available POS taggers modeled after
well-known techniques. The programs are written in C (aiming for
extreme portability and code correctness/safety) and run under various
UNIX flavors (and probably even under Windows). ACOPOST currently
consists of four taggers which are based on different frameworks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maximum Entropy Tagger MET: This tagger uses an iterative
      procedure to successively improve parameters for a set of
      features that help to distinguish between relevant
      contexts. It's based on a framework suggested by Ratnaparkhi
      [1997].</li>
  <li>Trigram Tagger T3: This kind of tagger is based on Hidden Markov
      Models (HMM) where the states are tag pairs that emit words,
      i. e., it's based on transitional and lexical probabilities. The
      technique has been suggested by Rabiner [1990] and the
      implementation is influenced by Brants [2000].</li>
  <li>Error-driven Transformation-based Tagger TBT: Transformation
      rules are learned from an annotated corpus which change the
      currently assigned tag depending on triggering context
      conditions. The general approach as well as the application to
      POS tagging has been proposed by Brill [1993].</li>
  <li>Example-based tagger ET: Example-based models (also called
      memory-based, instance-based or distance-based) rest on the
      assumption that cognitive behavior can be achieved by looking at
      past experiences that resemble the current problem rather than
      learning and applying abstract rules. They have been suggested
      for NLP by Daelemans et al. [1996].</li>
</ol>

can be found in an accompanying technical report
