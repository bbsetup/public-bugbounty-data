				<div class="article">This year I wanted to beat the pope and the Dutch King (Willem!), with some Christmas preaching. Unfortunately, I got up to late, and stuck into a suburb Christmas breakfast and they beat me to it (priorities, priorities!). <br>
<br>
In any case, have a great Christmas friends, and all the best for 2017, you might think it looks grim, but all those specs of light you represent can shine any darkness away. High five, have fun reading (or not)<br>
<br>
<b>Some Christmas preaching (2016 edition): Past a binary world</b><br>
<br>
Almost coming to the closing of interesting 2016, a year that many of us would agree upon could have been much better for many reasons. But let&#8217;s not forget, never forget, things only gain shape when you apply some sort of force. Negative things shape us as well as positive things. On a personal level as well as on a collective level. Agreed, the addition of negative aspects in our life can be questioned, but I know, keeping it close to myself, I wouldn&#8217;t be the person today without sjitty periods in my life, nor with the positive ones. We are a sum of it all. And if you are on your high, or on your low, it will pass, because time passes, it will alter you until you reach your endpoint, regardless if you exert control over it or not. Hardship is a key element when forming us into something potentially better than we were yesterday. <br>
<br>
And that is exactly what makes the comprehension of today&#8217;s reality so difficult. Because as much as things go for us as individuals, they go for all fellow human beings, at least to some extent. The closer people are to us, the more visibly their cracks are, and more often can we bring ourselves to understand the ones closest to us. Increasingly difficult it becomes the further away people are from us, while they are people, with their inherent flaws, their intrinsic beauty. Yet, the ones far away are equally judged by us despite the detail we have about their person. In some cases, it&#8217;s a necessity, one cannot judge everybody with the same range of criteria, we all know we should, but for reasons, sometimes practical, sometimes out of sheer naivety we lack to do this, we lack the patience, we forget to breath before we speak. <br>
<br>
Second comes the matter of temporality. As times moves, things change, so do we, once again as persons, and as a collective. Yet we tend to label someone as good or as bad, based on limited experiences. Change is something that is continues regardless of our current or past believes, and it happens on every level. That person that was a dipshit yesterday, could be your best friend tomorrow (or he could remain a dipshit)<br>
<br>
I guess what I am trying to say is that the world is so much more than binary, it&#8217;s a complex blob flying through space at an incredible speed which spins around, and with that spin, everything on it changes. For some reason, we seem to have forgotten that. You are an asshole or a good guy, black or white, this or that, but we tend to forget that we are so much more and our shapes changes all the time. Look at yourself for a moment, look where you came from and look where you are now. Now imagine that a good fraction of the people has traveled a similar route. Does this not humble you, underlines the appreciation for how connected we all are? The distance we traveled despite of all the negativity you see around you.  <br>
<br>
The appreciation of the complexity of it all, is the start of trying to unravel it, to understand one another. Let&#8217;s do less yelling, let&#8217;s reach out our hands to fellow human beings and step forward into the darkness that scares us so that we might for as long as it will take, move into the light again. <br>
Achievements are won, whenever the odds are not in your favour, for that, we need to leap forward, dare to take a gamble, realize that we can fail, but we will get up again, dare to keep on trying till we succeed, and this becomes so much easier if we can rely on each other. Instead of shooting fantasies down before they have any chance to crystalize, we should stimulate and inspire each other to reach for the unknown, to better ourselves. If we are always judged on our failings, we will never try, we will never leap, we will paralyze. We were meant to explore the unknown, to push each other forward. Isn&#8217;t there a serenity in the idea that if we actively care today, that on our days of unavoidable weakness someone will care for us? We are a resilient species, as individuals we shine when given the chance, when being in the right environment. It&#8217;s up to us to create such an environment in our respective bubbles.<br>
<br>
Don&#8217;t feel paralyzed, dare to reach out to one another. Be courageous by lending a helping hand with the smallest acts of kindness. The greatest farce of our time is the belief that we cannot conduct change. That as an individual you cannot move worlds, that power lays with those above us, corporations, government. What we often forget is that these institutes constitute of humans as well. The prospect of change can never be demolished by the chance of failure. Starting to believe in yourself is the first step in believing in each other. Don&#8217;t wait for others, move, work hard, fall and get up. It&#8217;s an illusion that the world needs saving at best we need saving from ourselves. You don&#8217;t need to fly across the globe to help others, I promise you, you can contribute your 5 cents of factual positive contribution right around the corner of where you are living. In this case the mantra, &#8220;longing for big will make you forget the fundament it was built on&#8221;; those small acts of kindness, the ones that do not earn &#8216;likes&#8217; persé. Let&#8217;s start inspiring by example. <br>
<br>
We need to stop dealing in absolutes, other that we might share some common values, disturbing elements whatever side they come from should never elute that what binds the majority, that is what we should strive for, that is the essence of human kindness. That is what Christmas represents to me. <br>
Warm Christmas wished from me.</div>

				<div class="article">It&#8217;s time to remember what Christmas is about; humanity and kindness<br>
Walking around the incredible beautiful Champs-Élysées, I don&#8217;t think the beauty of Paris in these respect is every going to stop amazing me. It&#8217;s magical, especially in those lonesome hours. Incredible spirited buildings, expressing history by just being present. It&#8217;s partly amplified during Christmas time, light emitting warmth begging for kindness to one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
The large Christmas market, with countless merchants trying to sell their products it being cheaply produced Christmas accessories produced in China, or the good foods fitting the season. The lights dressing the sides of the road sponsored by Ikea. Samsung making clear with sign that they took part in making this possible. And at least hundreds of people attracted by it, like mosquitos to a lamp. All under present under a false spirit of Christmas. <br>
<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s a shrill contrast however if you move away from the dressed streets. Countless homeless people, not only the classical drunkards and misfits but also young family&#8217;s mom&#8217;s with children. So many of them, all too young, far away from home. Present in a society that does not want you to be there. Children do not belong on the street, certainly not in what we perceive to be a civilized society. They sleep under the garments of the designer shops, display windows all trying to convince you to buy needless expensive gifts for your loved ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
The contrast hurts, it&#8217;s painful in regards to human essence, so painful we walk past it like it&#8217;s not there. They are allowed to sleep there after the shops close, when the streets grow empty, but have to leave before day breaks. We know they are there. But by not being openly confronted with them we can pretend that they are not real. Figments of our imagination, stories from the old books being displayed on the TV, far away from our safe homes. <br>
<br>
<br>
I have come to a point where I have difficulties understanding us. It&#8217;s painful to enjoy this season and at the same time seeing this happening, what could be the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War 2. We have come so far as a species, but in a state of distress we seem so far away from what we could have been, when we are tested in our true resilience we always seem to be so successful in failing. So engulfed in our selfishness so eager to believe in our own lies and forced truths. We seem in a state of paralysis. We actually stopped believing we could change the state of our society. Have we lost confidence in ourselves, are we so lost?<br>
<br>
<br>
I don&#8217;t think we are, we just stopped looking outside using our own eyes. Feeling with our own feelings, looking into our own hearths. We use the sketched impressions of populistic politicians to frame our reality. We allow ourselves to be fooled, to be engulfed in fear that will serve as the self-induced prison we life in. <br>
<br>
<br>
I know this reads like the story of a disappointed idealist, a cynic, but it isn&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t deny anybody a fantastic holiday season; I share in it. I like Christmas, sharing meals, joy and happiness with friends and families, but let&#8217;s not forget the real thought behind it. But what about those that sleep under our windows? In all our humbleness surely we can do more than nothing?<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember the Christmas story, the one from one of the holy books? That story about migrants in need, escaping the cold night. Let&#8217;s not be remembered as the people who closed the doors in time of need. Who denied a warm meal to those needy of it, indulging ourselves in greed. How will future generations look back at us? How will future you look back at this time, how your current character contributed with his or her passive attitude. <br>
Let&#8217;s be realistic, honest, but most important of all let us be kind-hearted to one another, show signs of humanity. If we can&#8217;t do that, what does Christmas imply, what does it stand for, what do we stand for? It will be nothing other than a hollow cold shell, its spirit left. Bring the essence into Christmas, the essence into being human, what could distinguish us from the more primal us. <br>
<br>
<br>
Together we can achieve greatness. Alone we are just that; alone. Do not look away, look at it, do not ignore reality. Induce change with the smallest acts of kindness. <br>
<br>
<br>
I wish you all a great sincere holiday season and all the best for the new year.</div>

				<div class="article"><b>Deze brief is gericht aan de Nijmeegse PvdA fractie. In de eerste week van april 2015 deed Groen Links Nijmegen in navolging tot diverse andere Nederlandse initiatieven een voorstel tot het experimenteren met het basis inkomen in Nederland. Een controversieel onderwerp. Echter met een snel veranderende arbeidsmarkt is het essentieel dat we nadenken over nieuwe vormen van inkomen en geluk. De PvdA fractie in Nijmegen schoot dit voorstel ongenadig en ondoordacht af voordat het vorm kon krijgen in de vorm van een klein experiment (<a href="http://www.nijmegen.pvda.nl/action/news/item/271/het-basisinkomen-tussen-droom-en-daad.html)." rel="external nofollow" title="http://www.nijmegen.pvda.nl/action/news/item/271/het-basisinkomen-tussen-droom-en-daad.html).">http://www.nijmegen.pvda....ssen-droom-en-daad.html).</a> Dit ondanks de partij nog volop in discussie is over dit onderwerp. Conservatieve politiek in mijn optiek. Gelukkig was de rest van de raad een stuk progressiever en kon dit voorstel op de VVD en PvdA na op brede steun rekenen. </b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>De PvdA Nijmegen en het basisinkomen; Een gebrek aan een progressieve visie</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Als (Nijmeegse) PvdA'er wil ik graag stevig mijn ongenoegen uiten over de actie van de Nijmeegse fractie aangaande het voorstel van Groen Links wat een opzet gaf tot de discussie en het mogelijk experimenteren met het basis inkomen in Nijmegen. Een progressief geluid mist compleet in deze kwestie aan de zijde van de Nijmeegse PvdA fractie. Laten we deze discussie voornamelijk even feitelijk houden. De arbeidsmarkt zal in de komende jaren nog drastischer veranderen dan dat hij voorheen deed. Niet alleen verdwijnen door automatisering banen in de klassieke industrie ook zijn de prognoses dat bijvoorbeeld banen in de transport sector zullen verdwijnen. (zie ook: <a href="http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2014-2015/werken-van-morgen.html)." rel="external nofollow" title="http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2014-2015/werken-van-morgen.html).">http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl.../werken-van-morgen.html).</a> Niet alleen de huidige economische crisis legt druk op de arbeidsmarkt maar ook de technologische evoluties doen dat in ongekende mate. We moeten het met elkaar eens zijn dat we de banen van vroeger en tot op zekere hoogte het werk van nu nooit meer zal terugkeren, ongeacht de hoeveelheid valse politieke beloftes die worden gemaakt. Dat klinkt beangstigend maar wetende dat dit realiteit gaat worden roept dit ook op tot een precedent om na te gaan denken over vernieuwingen in de arbeidsmarkt, op gebied van onderwijs en daarmee op een fundamenteler niveau; het inkomen en bestaan. <br>
<br>
Het voorstel aangaande het basisinkomen van Groen Links Nijmegen is een voorstel is in navolging van diverse andere gemeentes (Groningen, Wageningen). Ook in andere landen wordt veelvuldig met het basisinkomen geëxperimenteerd. Er is geen consensus of het basisinkomen een oplossing gaat bieden voor het huidige en het toekomstige verlies aan betaalde arbeid. Maar als wetenschapper durf ik te zeggen dat geen enkele econoom of andere wetenschapper die wijsheid momenteel in pacht heeft. Het mogelijke succes van een basisinkomen in Nederland berust momenteel op hypotheses en theorieën. Hoog tijd dus om hiermee op kleine schaal te gaan experimenteren, we hebben data nodig om hier zinnige conclusies aan te binden. De eerste resultaten uit landen die experimenten hebben uitgerold lijken veelbelovend maar zijn ook erg context specifiek. (<a href="http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2014-2015/experiment-gratis-geld.html)." rel="external nofollow" title="http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2014-2015/experiment-gratis-geld.html).">http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl...riment-gratis-geld.html).</a><br>
 <br>
De Partij van de Arbeid is in de essentie altijd diep verweven geweest met de zekerheid van inkomen en arbeid. Daarom was ik ook zeer verbaasd over de insteek die de Nijmeegse vraagstuk koos op het voorstel van Groen Links en de uitingen die zijn gedaan in de landelijke media. Dit heeft niets te maken met progressieve politiek maar alles te maken met een conservatieve gesloten blik. Ik vraag me ook oprecht af hoeveel leden deze afwijzing zouden ondersteunen zeker als het zo scherp wordt geformuleerd als Dhr. Van &#8216;t Veen tijdens de Nijmeegse kamerronde en Radio 1, wij zouden &#8216;principieel tegen zouden zijn&#8217;. Ook heeft dit weinig te maken met de landelijke koers die wij hebben gekozen als leden van de partij. (<a href="http://basisinkomen.nl/wp/twee-van-de-drie-moties-basisinkomen-aangenomen-op-congres-pvda/" rel="external nofollow" title="http://basisinkomen.nl/wp/twee-van-de-drie-moties-basisinkomen-aangenomen-op-congres-pvda/">http://basisinkomen.nl/wp...ngenomen-op-congres-pvda/</a>) De PvdA heeft een lange traditie als het gaat om participatie in de discussies met betrekking tot het basisinkomen, hoog tijd voor een reeks aan experimenten want alleen op deze manier kunnen we kennis vergaren over nieuwe vormen van bestaans en inkomen zekerheid. Het voorstel van Groen Links was ook niets meer dan een voorstel tot experimenteren, nadenken en discussiëren. Schandelijk dus dat de PvdA daar als ogenschijnlijk progressieve partij gelijk met gestrekt been op ingaat. Ook Monica Sie, directeur van het Wetenschappelijke bureau van de PvdA (Wiardi Beckman Stichting) zei afgelopen week in de Leeuwarder Courant dat de grootste voor en tegenstanders van het basis inkomen bij de PvdA zitten. Dat moeten we interpreteren als een oproep tot discussie en experimenteren. <br>
<br>
Of het basisinkomen een succes zal zijn moet blijken uit experimenten op lokale schaal, daar deze heel context specifiek zijn. Dat is de enige manier om data te vergaren en zinnige uitspraken te doen over dit vraagstuk. De complexe situatie op de arbeidsmarkt vraag om nieuwe oplossingen maar tegelijkertijd zullen we moeten accepteren dat klassieke arbeid door vergaande automatisering op den duur grotendeels zal verdwijnen. Het is aan de politiek om hier pro-actief op in te spelen. De PvdA Nijmegen spreekt op haar website over &#8216;utopische fantasieën&#8217;. Behalve dat dit statement van een zekere ongegronde arrogantie doordrongen is mist er ook nog iets zeer essentieels; De Nijmeegse fractie vergeet te melden de automatisering in deze wereld in een recent verleden ook tot de utopische fantasieën behoorde. Tegelijkertijd bieden deze &#8216;utopische fantasieën&#8217; een mogelijke blik in onze toekomst en onze nieuwe realiteit. Hier is echter wel durf en een progressieve blik voor nodig. Iets wat de Nijmeegse PvdA fractie hopelijk nog gaat vinden. Gelukkig staat de rest van de raad wel open voor nieuwe initiatieven en laat daarmee zien een stuk progressiever te zijn en lef te hebben dan de Nijmeegse PvdA fractie.</div>

<b>Voorwoord</b><br>
<i>Dit artikel is geschreven door een aantal Nijmeegse PvdA'ers die samen kwamen in de Burchtstraat te Nijmegen. Als groep Nijmeegse PvdA&#8217;ers die zich oprecht zorgen maken over de rol van de sociaal-democratie in onze huidige maatschappij hebben we een manifest geschreven. We geven de discussie graag een positieve, constructieve draai, maar de tijd voor reflectie is hoe dan ook aangebroken. Wat is de rol van de sociaal-democratie nog in onze huidige maatschappij, en hoe gaat we om met de nationale en internationale vraagstukken welke een hevige invloed hebben op alle aspecten van de maatschappij? Ook wij sturen aan op een partij brede discussie, en het overstijgen van oude denkkaders en dogma&#8217;s zoals links en rechts. Wij zijn op zoek naar een progressieve blik gevuld met visie en dragen daar graag met anderen aan bij.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Politics was once about beliefs and society. Now it is a worship of money</b><br>
<i>(Ooit ging politiek over visie, vertrouwen en maatschappij. Tegenwoordig draait het alleen om de overdreven gehechtheid aan geld)</i><br>
<br>
In Nederland waren het de sociaal-democratie en de christen-democratie die na de Tweede Wereldoorlog de basis hebben gelegd voor een liberale rechtsstaat, stabiele partijdemocratie en een breed in de samenleving verankerde verzorgingsstaat. Maar er is sinds die tijd heel veel veranderd 'Veel voorwaarden waarop het naoorlogse Europese samenlevingsmodel ooit steunde zijn aan het verdampen en eroderen. De oorzaken daarvan zijn divers en complex: van secularisering tot aan het postindustrieel verdwijnen van de arbeidersklasse, van globalisering en migratie tot aan zegenrijke ontvoogding en individualisering.'<sub>1</sub><br>
De sociaal-democratie in Nederland en ook in Europa verkeert in zwaar weer. De electorale positie van de PvdA is structureel slecht. Dit wordt naar onze mening niet alleen veroorzaakt door de rol die de PvdA speelt in het kabinet. De problemen zitten op een fundamenteler niveau en zijn globaal waar te nemen. 'It's the economy stupid', Clinton. 'New Labour', Tony Blair, 'het afschudden van de ideologische veren', Wim Kok, vergelijkbare ontwikkelingen zagen we in Duitsland onder Schröder. 'The worship of money', kreeg ook de sociaal-democratie in zijn greep. Het was een politieke keuze, van de PvdA, om mee te gaan in het experiment van vergaande liberalisering in de publieke sector, de zogenaamde &#8216;Derde Weg&#8217;, die we sinds de afgelopen twintig jaren blind aan het berijden zijn.<br>
<br>
In ons land zijn we in de afgelopen decennia de zeggenschap over cruciale onderdelen van onze samenleving kwijtgeraakt, voornamelijk in de sectoren die voorheen een sterke verankering in de publieke sector hadden. Het doordrukken van veranderingen en aanpassingen heeft in een veel te hoog tempo plaatsgevonden, dit zonder deze ingrijpende ontwikkelingen uitgebreid te evalueren. Voornamelijk op voor de PvdA belangrijke beleidsterreinen en dat heeft geleid tot grote onvrede en teleurstellingen bij de burger. Denk daarbij aan de zorgsector, geïllustreerd door de chaos rond de PGB's en de thuiszorg. Het onderwijs, de aanpassingen rond de studiefinanciering en het ongefundeerde rendementsdenken. De onzekerheid en onduidelijkheid over de pensioenvoorziening voor de jeugd van vandaag en morgen. De woningcorporaties die losgezongen zijn van hun primaire taken en de daaruit voortvloeiende oplopende huren en de misselijkmakende verrijkingen en verspillingen. Het geblunder rond het Gronings gas. Het JSF-debacle. Om het over de banken nog maar niet te hebben. Daarnaast zien we steeds vaker hoe er vanuit de EU beslissingen zonder brede steun van de burger worden genomen. Het debat over het TTIP-verdrag illustreert hoe beslissingen met een grote impact op onze maatschappij de nationale soevereiniteit kunnen ondermijnen. Beslissingen die worden genomen zonder breed draagvlak onder onze bevolking doen het vertrouwen in de politiek verdampen.<br>
<br>
In het rapport van de commissie Dijsselbloem over de onderwijshervormingen Tijd voor onderwijs uit 2008 werd in algemene bewoordingen gesteld dat 'majeure operaties eerst in de praktijk beproefd moeten worden en niet gepaard mogen gaan met bezuinigingen.&#8217;<br>
<br>
Deze les is geheel genegeerd zo betoogt ook Willem Witteveen in zijn pleidooi, De wet als kunstwerk, waarin hij schrijft dat wetten redelijk en begrijpelijk moeten zijn, geschreven op grond van blijvende waarden en houdbaar voor de toekomst. Hij verzet zich tegen gelegenheidswetten die partijpolitieke of coalitiepolitieke doeleinden op de korte termijn dienen. Een pleidooi dat wij van harte ondersteunen.<br>
<br>
Een drietal principes vormt de basis van onze agenda om de PvdA weer de partij te laten zijn die de mensen grip geeft op de kwesties die ze niet alleen kunnen oplossen: absolute waardevastheid, het herwaarderen van collectieve voorwaarden en actie en de PvdA als laboratorium van progressieve ideeën. Als herkenbare waarden het fundament zijn van politiek handelen, ontstaat een echt alternatief programma. Dan valt er iets te kiezen en kunnen mensen dingen veranderen via het uitbrengen van hun stem. Experimenteren met nieuwe vormen en gedachten aangaande democratie (gekozen bestuurders, referenda) en 'mehr Demokratie wagen' (naar het motto van Willy Brandt) zijn daar onlosmakelijk mee verbonden.<br>
<br>
Dit is geen pleidooi om onze verantwoordelijkheid te ontlopen. Ons uitgangspunt is dat we de rit uitzitten, maar we moeten ons nu gaan voorbereiden op de toekomst van de PvdA en Nederland. Het zal niet vanzelf weer goed komen. Dat is misplaatst wensdenken. Kijk naar de visieloze agenda van de VVD: sneuvelen in het kalifaat, nauwe betrekkingen met dictators die mensenrechten schenden en het sluiten van de Europese buitengrenzen. Het is nu tijd ons te bezinnen op een progressieve toekomst met een heldere visie. We moeten afstand nemen van de kwartetkaarten-politiek die ons niets brengt en ons vervreemdt van onze kiezers. Het gaat om de zoektocht om onze eigen ideologie te herdefiniëren.<br>
<br>
Wat ons betreft nemen we afscheid van een positie in het centrum van de macht, wat bijna per definitie leidt tot centristische (kleurloze) politiek. De sleutel tot succes is het creëren van duurzame en progressieve samenwerking gericht op een meerderheidsregering, oftewel: machtsvorming met partijen die deze visie delen. De huidige politieke koers, het voeren van een centristische compromispolitiek zoals momenteel onder Rutte II gebeurt, draagt bij aan de totale onherkenbaarheid en afwezigheid van progressief en door onze achterban breed gedragen beleid in de politiek. Dit wordt veroorzaakt door het ontbreken van een eigen ideologische visie en politieke agenda. Laten we dus eerst naar onszelf kijken. Daar moeten we de komende tijd onze energie in stoppen.<br>

				<div class="article">Wellicht herinneren jullie mijn post nog m.b.t. de vrije artsen keuze. Een ontwikelling die voor mij de constante afbraak van onze zorgstaat illustreert, een trend die is ingezet in 2005/2006 toen we naar een geliberaliseerde zorgmarkt toe bewogen. Mooie beloftes waren er gemaakt. De markt zou het klusje wel klaren; meer transparantie, lagere kosten en hogere kwaliteit. En hoewel we eigelijk niet weten hoe we dit moeten evalueren gebeurd het in eerste instantie ook niet, die intentie lijkt te missen en dat is zeer zorgelijk! Gelukkig zijn er wel enkele pogingen ondernomen en het verhaal is alles behalve mooi. Hier moeten consequenties aan verbonden worden; het grote zorg experiment is mislukt ten koste van de burger. Maargoed mijn uitgebreide repliek kunnen jullie lezen in de post van twee weken geleden; <a href="https://ammer.tweakblogs.net/blog/11232/de-zondag-avond-brief-%28over-de-zorgwet%29" rel="external">De Zondag avond brief</a>, deze brief was gericht aan Diederik Samsom, die dapper het beleid van de PvdA verdedigt, een onverdedigbaar beleid wat mij betreft. Maar hij (of een van de medewerker heeft gereageerd. Een reactie die wat mij betreft de bittere armoede in de politiek perfect illustreert, maar oordeel vooral zelf;<blockquote><div class="quote"><b>Diederik Samsom</b><br>
Beste Amrish<br>
<br>
We zijn het geheel eens. Het gaat niet goed in de zorg nu. We willen een publiek stelsel, met publieke verzekeraars die de zorg inrichten (en dus zónder vrije artsenkeuze maar dat terzijde). Dat staat ook in ons programma. <br>
<br>
Nu doet zich de situatie voor dat we dat publieke stelsel niet hebben. En ook niet gaan krijgen zolang alleen de PvdA er voor is. <br>
<br>
Wat doen we dan? Nogmaals herhalen hoe slecht het huidige stelsel is; tegen alles stemmen omdat we 'eerst het stelsel fundamenteel moeten wijzigen'? <br>
<br>
Of zorgvuldig kijken hoe je binnen dit stelsel voor de sociaal-democratie resultaten kunt bereiken en stapje voor stapje naar een solidairder systeem bewegen dan we vandaag de dag hebben?<br>
<br>
Dat is in essentie de vraag. Ik weet het antwoord wel<br>
<br>
Met vriendelijke groet<br>
<br>
Diederik Samsom</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote"><b>Ik</b><br>
Beste Diederik, <br>
<br>
Een goed politiek antwoord, overigens is de SP hier ook voor te porren. Dit is volgzame politiek niet de leidende rol waar ik op inspeel, de rol die we zouden moeten kiezen. Sommige zaken zouden we niet moeten willen als sociaal democratische partij, waar we onszelf niet verliezen in consessie politiek. Overigens ben ik erg benieuwd welk stapje we dan hebben gezet dat streeft naar het sociaal-democratische beleid. <br>
<br>
Ik weet het antwoord namelijk niet.<br>
<br>
Fijne avond,</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote"><b>Diederik Samsom</b><br>

Beste Diederik, <br>
<br>
Fijn dat je de tijd neemt om de antwoorden, dat waardeer ik ten zeerste. ik begrijp dat je het druk hebt. Op een begeven moment worden wat mij betreft keuzes inderdaad fundamenteel. Je kunt je erg verliezen in compromissen in de politiek. Wellicht kun je je publieke sterk uitspreken dat we weer terug willen naar een publiek zorgstelsel, dit zal inderdaad niet worden gewaardeerd door een coalitie partner maar het zal ten zeerste worden gewaardeerd door de PvdA stemmer. Ik wil geen PvdA lid zijn dat zich constant negatief uitlaat, zo ben ik niet en dat is weinig productief. Maar ben wel erg stellig in de overtuiging dat het tijd is om keuzes te maken, duidelijk keuzes die niet teveel verwateren in het polderen en nuance, de wereld is inderdaad niet zwart-wit maar we kunnen wel een richting kiezen. Het land bevindt zich in een crisis en daar kunnen we alleen maar sterker uitkomen als we fundamentele keuzes durven te maken en een visie duidelijk durven uit te dragen. <br>
<br>
Lijstjes met aankondigingen voor maatregelen en korte epistelen overtuigen mij helaas niet. Daar ben ik te kritisch voor. Gegeven, we pakken kleine winsten her en der. Maar we zijn een onderdeel van de coalitie niet van de oppositie. <br>
<br>
We hebben elkaar overigens ontmoet in 2007, bij de opening van het academisch nieuwe jaar aan de Wageningen Universiteit, toen ik nog een onbezorgt studentenbestaan leide. Je was daar samen met Wouter Bos, jullie kwamen daar ontzettend sterk en symphatiek over. Dat sentiment mis ik soms, de uitstraling gedrevenheid en zelfverzekerdheid en het maken van keuzen.<br>
<br>
Voor nu wens ik jou en je familie fijne feestdagen. <br>
<br>
Hartelijke groeten,</div></blockquote>Helaas niet meer van Diederik Samsom en/of zijn medewerker gehoord, verder dan lijstjes komen we niet, en dat is nu precies ons probleem. Visie en passie dat is wat ontbreekt in de politiek.
